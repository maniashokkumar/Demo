When generating Angular routes in app.routes.ts or app-routing.module.ts,
always use `loadChildren` to lazy load a module instead of assigning a component directly.
Do not use `component: SomeComponent` in route configs directly.
If thereâ€™s no module, create one with the same name as the component.
